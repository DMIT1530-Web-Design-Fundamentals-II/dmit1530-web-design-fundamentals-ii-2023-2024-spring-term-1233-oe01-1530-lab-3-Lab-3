## Lab 03: Toggle Navigation With Drop-Down Menu

**Weight**: 5% of your final grade

---

## Instructions

Clone a copy of this repository to your device so that you can develop it locally. When you finish, make sure to push your latest commit to GitHub Classroom. 

For this Lab, you will create a website with a fully responsive navigation. In the smallest (mobile) view, the user should be able to show and hide (toggle) the navigation with the click of a button. In the largest (desktop) view, the user should be able to hover or tab over a dropdown menu. 

---

## The Build Methodology

Start by writing all of your HTML for ``index.html``. Remember to fill out all of your ``<meta>`` element information.

Next, you will need a ``<header>``, followed by a ``<main>``. 

Inside of your ``<header>``, you'll need a first-level heading, your monkey logo, and a ``<nav>`` with three drop-down menus. These menus should be structured as follows: 

    1. GAMES
        - CS:GO
        - DOTA 2
        - Fortnite
        - League of Legends
        - Overwatch
        - Pok√©mon
        - PUGB
    
    2. SCHEDULE
        - Australia & EU
        - East Asia
        - North America
    
    3. REGISTER
        - Individual Competitors
        - Team Events

Because of the different states and layouts of your navigation menu, you will need a number of wrappers and helper classes (ex. .inner-container, .wide-flex, and .flex-container).

The skeleton of your code should look something like this:

```HTML
	    <header>
        <div class="inner-container wide-flex">
            <div class="flex-container">
                <!-- First-Level Heading Here -->
                <div class="menu-icon">
                    <!-- Controller Icon Here -->
                </div> <!-- end of .menu-icon -->
            </div> <!-- end of .flex-container -->
            <nav>
                <ul class="main-menu">
                    <!--  -->
                </ul>
            </nav> 
        </div> <!-- end of .inner-container -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <!-- Main Content Here -->
    </main>
```

### CSS

Begin with universal styles and helper classes, your mobile view, any classes necessary for your toggle menu and JavaScript, and finally your media queries. 


## JS

Be mindful of your CSS and the class names that you gave to specific elements when using the toggle script that we learned during our hamburger menu demo. 

#### Part 1

Complete the required Javascript that you need to show and/or hide the navigational menu when the user clicks on the joystick icon. You may use the script that you learned earlier in the semester; however, you must be mindful of which class or selector needs to be passed into each method.

#### Part 2

On your own, research at least one (1) new CSS properties on MDN. This property should be one that we have not covered in class. 

When you have chosen the property you'd like to use, add it to your page. In order to make it work, you may add additional elements to the `<main>` area, including text and/or images.

Some ideas include:

* animation
* backdrop-filter
* filter
* mix-blend-mode
* transform

Finally, add a comment at the top of your `styles.css` that explains which new property you used.
